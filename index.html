	and my brother was born in California, so two Canadian and an American in our family.

	<p class="content">I am a French Horn player, but because of my schedule, I am not taking any music courses now.
	Fun fact, the serial number of my French Horn ends with 007, therefore I always call it Mr. 007 :) </p>

	<p class="content">I love driving, and I drives a 2000 Mitsubishi Galant, yes, that Galant with 
	Carbon Fiber hood is mine. This car is not fast at all, but it fits my need, and I love it.</p>
